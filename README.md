Anti-PD-1 (anti-PD-1) immunotherapy reinvigorates CD8 T cell responses in cancer patients but PD-1 is also expressed by other immune cells, including follicular helper CD4 T cells (Tfh) which are involved in germinal center (GC) responses. Little is known, however, about the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy on non-cancer immune responses in humans. To investigate this question, we examined the impact of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy on the Tfh-B cell axis responding to unrelated viral antigens. Following influenza vaccination, a subset of adults receiving anti-PD-1 had more robust circulating Tfh (cTfh) responses than adults not receiving immunotherapy. PD-1 pathway blockade resulted in transcriptional signatures of increased cellular proliferation in cTfh and responding B cells compared to controls. These latter observations suggest an underlying change in the Tfh-B cell and GC axis in a subset of immunotherapy patients. Together, these results demonstrate dynamic effects of anti-PD-1 therapy on influenza vaccine responses and highlight analytical vaccination as an approach that may reveal underlying immune predisposition to adverse events.
